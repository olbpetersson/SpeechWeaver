\begin{abstract}
Requirements are crucial in software engineering and there is ample support
for how to elicit and document them; however, relatively little support exist
for requirements maintenance. We argue that lightweight methods for annotating
requirements are needed and present a system based on speech recognition to
enable it. This paper describes the system design and a set of experiments and
user tests to validate its use. For more realistic evaluation our system has
been adapted to the commercial requirements management tool SystemWeaver.
Results show that the accuracy of free text speech input is not high enough to
enable free-form addition and edits to requirements. However, requirements
identification and annotation is practical by extending the system with 
string distance calculations to the set of requirements being matched. Lookup times on industrial
requirements data was deemed practical in
user tests, in particular for annotations on the go and during requirement reviews.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Systemite AB for their cooperation, help and engagement in this thesis. Moreover, we would like to thank our supervisor Robert Feldt. Without you the thesis would not have been what it is today. We would also like to thank whoever coined the expression "how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood". It has been a tremendous help during our many hours of testing and evaluation of the speech recognizer. Finally, we thank our friends and family for their love and support. \\[1cm]
